== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't preview button working? =

* Your image URL is invalid. Take a look at Settings → Getting started.

= Does FIFU save the images in the media library? =

* No. Only the PRO version is capable of doing this, but it is optional. The plugin was designed to work with external images.

= Why the featured image is being displayed twice? =

* You enabled "Featured Image in Content" option unnecessarily.

= Why the featured image is not being displayed? =

* Please check if "Hide Featured Media" option is unduly enabled.

= Why are there no changes after updating the settings? =

* Try to clear your cache.

= Is any action necessary before removing FIFU?

* Access settings and clear the metadata.

= What's the metadata created by FIFU?

* Database registers that help WordPress components to work with external images. This plugin can generate the metadata of ~50,000 image URLs per minute.

= What are the disadvantages of external images?

* No image optimization or thumbnails by default. You can fix that with CDN + Optimized Thumbnails feature (performance settings).

= What are the advantages of external images?

* You save money on storage, processing and copyright. And you can have extremely fast import processes.

= Is it legal to embed images without permission?

* Yes, it is. Click [here](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/embedding-images-the-legal-way-to-steal/) to know more.

= Do external images affect SEO?

* No, external images don't affect SEO. Click [here](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/does-using-a-cdn-improve-ranking/) to know more.

= Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error

* During activation, the plugin tries to change a column in the database to support URLs longer than 256 characters. If the plugin cannot be activated, it's possible that your site doesn't have enough memory to support the column resizing operation, especially if your database is too large. In this case, try to increase the memory of your site.
